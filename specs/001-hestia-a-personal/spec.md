# Feature Specification: Hestia - Personal On-Demand Service Gateway

**Feature Branch**: `001-hestia-a-personal`  
**Created**: September 8, 2025  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "Hestia, a personal, on-demand service gateway. My core problem is managing numerous personal projects (like LLMs, databases, and custom APIs) that are scattered across different machines‚Äîmy laptop, a powerful remote HPC server, etc. Running these services 24/7 is wasteful, especially on shared resources, but manually starting and stopping them for each session is tedious and error-prone. Hestia should act as a single, smart entry point for all my client applications. When a request comes in, Hestia must be intelligent enough to understand what the request needs. If the required service isn't running, Hestia must automatically start it on the most appropriate machine based on pre-configured rules (e.g., large AI models run on the HPC, smaller services run locally). Once the service is active, Hestia should seamlessly connect the client to it. Crucially, Hestia must also monitor for inactivity. If a service hasn't been used for a configurable period, Hestia should automatically shut it down to conserve resources. The entire process should be transparent to the client application, which only ever needs to know Hestia's stable address."

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies  
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
A developer working on personal projects across multiple machines wants to access any service (LLM, database, API) without manually managing which services are running where. They send a request to Hestia's stable address, and Hestia automatically determines what service is needed, starts it on the appropriate machine if it's not running, routes the request, and returns the response. After periods of inactivity, Hestia automatically shuts down idle services to conserve resources.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a service is not currently running, **When** a client sends a request that requires that service, **Then** Hestia automatically starts the service on the appropriate machine and routes the request
2. **Given** a service is already running, **When** a client sends a request for that service, **Then** Hestia immediately routes the request without starting anything
3. **Given** a service has been idle for the configured timeout period, **When** the timeout expires, **Then** Hestia automatically shuts down the service
4. **Given** multiple machines are available for a service type, **When** a request comes in, **Then** Hestia selects the appropriate machine based on pre-configured rules
5. **Given** a client application needs to access services, **When** making requests, **Then** the client only needs to know Hestia's address and the process is transparent
6. **Given** an unmodified client configured with a service-prefixed base URL, **When** it calls `http://localhost:8080/services/{serviceId}/...`, **Then** Hestia transparently proxies the request to the appropriate service and returns the response

### Edge Cases
- What happens when a machine designated for a service is unavailable or unreachable?
- How does the system handle when a service fails to start properly?
- What occurs if multiple requests come in simultaneously for the same inactive service?
- How does the system behave when a service crashes during operation?
- What happens if Hestia itself needs to restart - how are running services tracked?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST act as a single entry point that client applications can send requests to
- **FR-002**: System MUST automatically determine which backend service is needed based on incoming requests
- **FR-003**: System MUST automatically start required services when they are not currently running
- **FR-004**: System MUST route requests to the appropriate running service and return responses to clients
- **FR-005**: System MUST select the appropriate machine to start services on based on pre-configured rules
- **FR-006**: System MUST monitor service activity and automatically shut down services after configurable idle periods
- **FR-007**: System MUST make the entire process transparent to client applications
- **FR-008**: System MUST persist service configurations and machine assignments across restarts
- **FR-009**: System MUST track which services are currently running and on which machines
 - **FR-010**: System MUST handle service startup failures via a configurable policy: retry with a configurable limit and delay, then attempt a fallback machine based on pre-configured rules; if all attempts fail, return a clear error to the client and record the failure event.
 - **FR-011**: System SHOULD support optional authentication. When enabled, API requests use API keys and the dashboard uses username/password; when disabled, the system MUST warn about reduced security.
 - **FR-012**: System MUST queue incoming requests targeting an inactive service until that service is healthy, then forward the queued requests in order; concurrent duplicate startups for the same service MUST be prevented.
 - **FR-013**: System MUST provide configurable logging and basic observability. At minimum, capture: request routing decisions, service start/stop events, startup failures and retries, health/readiness status changes, idle shutdowns, and authentication decisions (excluding sensitive data). Logging levels MUST be user-configurable.
    - Recommendation: Support structured logs and an optional activity timeline summarizing the above events; expose basic metrics such as counts and durations for starts, retries, and routed requests.
 - **FR-014**: System MUST support HTTP APIs only in this phase; other protocols are explicitly out of scope.
 - **FR-015**: System MUST determine service readiness via a configurable readiness check. Preferred: an HTTP health endpoint indicating success. If no health endpoint is provided, allow a fallback such as a fixed warm-up period before accepting requests. The readiness condition MUST be definable per service.
    - Recommendation: Where appropriate, allow additional readiness options such as a simple probe request or detecting a service-ready signal.
- **FR-016**: System MUST expose a stable gateway on a single port (8080) and provide transparent, service-prefixed proxy paths at `/services/{serviceId}/...` to enable unmodified clients to integrate by changing only their base URL.

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **Service**: Represents a backend service (LLM, database, API) with its configuration, resource requirements, and current state
- **Machine**: Represents a compute resource (laptop, HPC server) with its capabilities, connection details, and current load
- **Routing Rule**: Defines which types of services should run on which machines based on criteria like resource requirements
- **Activity Monitor**: Tracks usage patterns and idle times for running services to enable automatic shutdown
- **Request Route**: Maps incoming client requests to specific backend services and their locations
