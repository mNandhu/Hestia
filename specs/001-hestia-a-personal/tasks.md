## Parallel Groups Legend
[P] = Tasks can run in parallel (different files). No [P] for tasks touching same file/area.

## Strategy-based Routing (Service-agnostic)

Context: Hestia supports plugin strategies discovered from `strategies/` (see T017). Routing must remain service-agnostic: Hestia is not specific to Ollama. Each service can opt into its own strategy and rules (e.g., model-aware routing for LLMs, region-aware for others). Strategies select an upstream base URL per-request via a `request_context` derived from the incoming request.

T032. [Spec/Design] Strategy routing requirements and config schema
- Define service-agnostic config keys in `hestia_config.yml`:
	- `services.<id>.instances: [ { url, weight?, region? } ]`
	- `services.<id>.strategy: <name>` (optional, default none)
	- `services.<id>.routing.by_model: { <key>: <instance_url> }` (example strategy-specific mapping)
- Document how `request_context` is constructed (path, headers, body fields like `model`, query params).
- Dependencies: T017, T014
 - Status: DONE (config schema added to ServiceConfig; request_context defined and used; examples documented)

T033. [Tests] Integration tests for strategy-based routing [P]
- Add `tests/integration/test_strategy_routing.py`:
	- Given instances A/B and `routing.by_model` mapping, requests with model=X route to A, model=Y to B.
	- When no mapping matches, fallback to load balancer selection.
	- Use `respx` to assert correct upstream URLs are called (no hardcoded Ollama assumptions; use generic `serviceId`).
- Dependencies: T032
 - Status: DONE (tests/integration/test_strategy_routing.py implemented and passing)

T034. [Source] Load strategies on startup and wire into request path
- In `src/hestia/app.py`, load strategies at startup (`load_strategies("strategies")`) and keep a registry reference.
- In dispatcher (`POST /v1/requests`) and transparent proxy, before constructing target URL:
	- Build `request_context` (e.g., parsed JSON body fields including `model`, headers, query params, path).
	- Resolve upstream base URL via configured strategy:
		- If `routing.by_model` exists, prefer exact match.
		- Else call `load_balancer.get_next_instance(service_id, request_context)`.
		- Fallback to `service_config.base_url` if none.
- Dependencies: T017, T032
 - Status: DONE (strategies loaded at startup; request_context built; resolution via strategy/LB/fallback wired)

T035. [Source] Provide a minimal model-aware router strategy (example)
- Add `strategies/model_router.py` with `register_strategy(registry)`:
	- `route_request(service_id, request_context, config)` returns instance URL based on arbitrary mapping (e.g., `by_model`).
	- Delegates to load balancer when no direct hit.
- Keep generic; do not assume Ollama-specific shapes beyond a configurable key name (default `model`).
- Dependencies: T017, T032
 - Status: DONE (strategies/model_router.py implemented and registered)

T036. [Config/Docs] Extend examples for strategies and routing
- Update example `hestia_config.yml` to include `instances` and `routing` blocks.
- Document service-agnostic patterns in `strategies/README.md` with a short example.
- Dependencies: T032, T035
 - Status: DONE (hestia_config.yml example extended; strategies/README.md updated)

T037. [Tests] Health/fallback and LB integration [P]
- Integration tests:
	- When chosen instance is down (respx 503/timeout), mark unhealthy and next request selects alternative.
	- Ensure instance recovery toggles health back to healthy on 200.
- Dependencies: T033, T034
 - Status: DONE (comprehensive health tracking integration tests passing; failover and recovery working correctly)

T038. [Source] Observability for routing
- Add structured logs and metrics for routing decisions:
	- Which strategy selected, selected instance URL, reason (mapping hit / LB / fallback).
	- Counters per strategy and per service.
- Dependencies: T025, T034
 - Status: DONE (routing decision logs and metrics integrated; resolution_reason tracking added)

T039. [Docs] Quickstart and spec updates
- Update `specs/001-hestia-a-personal/quickstart.md` with routing examples.
- Update `contracts` or notes if we expose any strategy inspection endpoints (optional).
- Dependencies: T033, T034
 - Status: DONE (comprehensive strategy routing examples added to quickstart; strategy inspection endpoint documented)

T040. [Optional] Strategy inspection endpoint [P]
- Add `/v1/strategies` listing loaded strategies and per-service strategy configuration (read-only).
- Dependencies: T017
 - Status: DONE (endpoint implemented; returns loaded strategies info and per-service configuration)

# Semaphore Integration: Remote Service Management

T041. [Contract Tests] Semaphore API contract [P]
- Create contract tests for Hestia <-> Semaphore API: service start/stop requests, error handling, status polling
- Endpoints: `/v1/semaphore/start`, `/v1/semaphore/stop`, `/v1/semaphore/status`
- Dependencies: T003
 - Status: DONE (comprehensive contract tests created with 12 test cases covering all endpoints, validation, and error handling)

T042. [Integration Tests] Remote service startup/shutdown [P]
- `tests/integration/test_semaphore_startup.py`: When a service is cold, Hestia requests Semaphore to start it, queues requests, and forwards when ready
- `tests/integration/test_semaphore_shutdown.py`: After idle timeout, Hestia requests Semaphore to stop the service
- Dependencies: T041
 - Status: TODO

T043. [Source] Semaphore API client and orchestration logic
- Implement Semaphore client in Hestia; wire into cold start and idle shutdown flows
- Support config-driven orchestration: per-service/host startup/shutdown policies
- Dependencies: T042
 - Status: TODO

T044. [Config/Docs] Extend config and docs for Semaphore
- Update `hestia_config.yml` to support remote orchestration policies
- Document Semaphore integration, config options, and example flows
- Dependencies: T043
 - Status: TODO
